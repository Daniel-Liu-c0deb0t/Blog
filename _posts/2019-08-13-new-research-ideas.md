title: "Coming up with new research ideas"

I believe that working efficiently is more important than blindly throwing time at a project. For my research work, I spend a lot more time _thinking_ instead of _implementing_. I think it is important to have good programming and problem solving (competitive math/programming) fundamentals, so the bottleneck in the research process is in coming up with new ideas. Here are a few ways to acquire new ideas to explore:

## 1. Working forwards

Read research papers, and closely examine previous work. Then, attempt to find details that they miss, or "future work" that they have not done yet. There should always be _something_ that the previous work misses, because researchers have limited time to put into their work.

## 2. Working backwards

Examine the main research problem from another angle that is not yet examined in a previous work. Usually, this involves defining a new metric. For example, if the previous work claims to achieve a high score under a certain metric, then come up with a different meaningful metric and attempt to get better results under this new metric.

## 3. Diversity

When working on a research problem and its subproblems, try to find diverse, marginally related ideas and attempt to connect them to the research problem. Sometimes, this connection may be novel. Even if this connection proves fruitless, it may reveal an alternative approach to the problem. The marginally related ideas can be found through learning. In fact, when learning about new topics, I often think about connecting those new topics to each of the research problems I have tackled before.
