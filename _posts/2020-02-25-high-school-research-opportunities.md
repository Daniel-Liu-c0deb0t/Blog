It is difficult to get started doing research as a high school student without any existing connections with companies or university labs. Therefore, I have compiled a list of notable activities, programs, and awards that I have heard of. Obviously, I have not included every possible opportunity, but these should get interested and motivated students started with doing STEM research.

Have fun doing research!
